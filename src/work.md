         This self-portrait is, entirely made up of triangles, this was achieved by carefully outlining
    triangles of different size and using the live paint tool to fill each one. The colors of the portrait choosen were 
    from the orginal photo however I choose a purple background because it was complimentary to the green coat.

        The objective of this project was to create a 3D realistic chessboard using Illustrator. 
    I made the chess pieces by outlining half of the pieces, then using the 3D render tool to add some dimensionality.
    The hardest part was making the horse chess piece because unlike the others which were symmetrical, 
    the horse had to be made by rendering the bottom and outlining the top half.

  This work was made during my first semester of college, the objective was to create a postcard for a city of my choosing -
    I picked New York, the hardest aspect of this project was the color scheme. It was challenging to find colors that
    would work together. I choose colors that were more pastel and dreamy like a peaceful evening atmosphere. I wanted the work to be fun in colors 
    and make the viewer feel warm and excited.

The Project was to create an app that would be beneficial to BMCC students.
    My app focuses on creating coupons and codes for BMCC students, which would be accessed through various categories
    such as in-store and online options. The app is inspired by other coupon and food apps like Grubhub and Honey.
